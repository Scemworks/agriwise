                India has over 120 million farmers, with 86% operating on small
                farms of less than 2 hectares. These farmers face challenges
                including unpredictable weather, fluctuating market prices,
                limited access to credit, and a lack of timely agricultural
                information.

                AgriWise bridges this gap by combining artificial intelligence,

                those who need it most, and that every farmer deserves the tools
                to succeed in an increasingly complex agricultural landscape.
