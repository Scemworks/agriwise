#### **Access the Application**

## Indian Weather API proxy

This project includes a small server-side proxy to the Indian Weather API (indianapi.in).

How to configure:

- Create a `.env.local` at the project root and add your API key:

```
INDIANAPI_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

- Endpoints exposed by the app (server-side):
	- GET /api/weather/india?city=Chennai  -> proxies to indianapi.in/india/weather
	- GET /api/weather/india/cities       -> proxies to indianapi.in/india/cities

	Sandbox and global endpoints

	If you don't have an API key or want to test without consuming quota, enable sandbox mode by adding to `.env.local`:

	```
	INDIANAPI_SANDBOX=true
	```

	In sandbox mode the proxy will use the Indian API sandbox base (no key required). To use the real API provide `INDIANAPI_KEY`.

	Global endpoints (proxying aggregated global data):
	- GET /api/weather/global/current?location=London
	- GET /api/weather/global/weather?location=London&days=2
	- GET /api/weather/global/forecast?location=Paris&days=3

The frontend weather page at `src/app/weather/page.tsx` is wired to call `/api/weather/india`.

## Local demo auth API

This project includes simple demo auth routes using JWT for local testing. They live under `src/app/api/auth` and are intentionally minimal. Replace the in-memory user store in `src/lib/auth.ts` with a real database for production.

Endpoints:
- POST /api/auth/register { email, password, name? } -> { user, token }
- POST /api/auth/login { email, password } -> { user, token }
- POST /api/auth/verify { token } -> { valid: true, user }

Notes:
- A `JWT_SECRET` environment variable can be set to change the signing secret. Otherwise a dev secret is used.
- CORS headers are applied by the `withCors` helper in `src/lib/cors.ts` when wrapping handlers.

## Postgres + Prisma (production-ready auth)

This project includes a Prisma schema for a `User` model and helper utilities for a Postgres-backed auth flow.

Quick start:

1. Create a Postgres database and set `DATABASE_URL` in a `.env` file (see `.env.example`).
2. Install dependencies and generate Prisma client:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm prisma:migrate
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The API routes `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, and `/api/auth/verify` are wired to the Prisma-backed auth helpers. Tokens are stored in a HttpOnly cookie for better security.

Replace the in-memory store with a production-ready DB (already done — Prisma + Postgres). For production, set `NODE_ENV=production`, `JWT_SECRET`, and secure the cookie origins.
